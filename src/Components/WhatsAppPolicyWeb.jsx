            <strong>Data Security in Online Transactions:</strong> Info Edge (India) Limited uses the maximum care as is possible to ensure that all or any data / information in respect of electronic transfer of money does not fall in the wrong hands. For completing online transactions involving payments a user is directed to a Payment Gateway, Info Edge India Ltd does not store or keep credit card data.

          Refund in Failed Transactions

          Though IEIL payment reconciliation team works on a 24 x 7 basis, IEIL offers no guarantees whatsoever for the accuracy or timeliness of the refunds reaching the Subscribers card/bank accounts. This is on account of the multiplicity of organizations involved in processing of online transactions, the problems with Internet infrastructure currently available and working days/holidays of financial institutions. Refunds in the event of wrong/objectionable property content being posted on the site would be at the discretion of 99acres.
